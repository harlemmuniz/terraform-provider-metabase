  A Metabase user.

# metabase_user (Resource)

A Metabase user.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a user without password - Metabase will send a welcome email
# for the user to set their own password
resource "metabase_user" "john" {
  email      = "john@example.com"
  first_name = "John"
  last_name  = "Doe"
}

# Create a user with a specific password
resource "metabase_user" "jane" {
  email      = "jane@example.com"
  first_name = "Jane"
  last_name  = "Smith"
  password   = "secure-password-456"
}

# Create a user and add them to groups using separate membership resources
resource "metabase_permissions_group" "analytics" {
  name = "Analytics"
}

resource "metabase_permissions_group_membership" "jane_analytics" {
  user_id          = metabase_user.jane.id
  group_id         = metabase_permissions_group.analytics.id
  is_group_manager = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) The email address of the user.
- `first_name` (String) The first name of the user.
- `last_name` (String) The last name of the user.

### Optional

- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for the user (optional, only used during creation).

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of the user.

## Notes

### Password Behavior

The `password` field is optional:

- **Without password**: If you don't provide a password, Metabase will automatically send a welcome email to the user. The user can then click the link in the email to set their own password.
- **With password**: If you provide a password, the user will be created with that password and no welcome email will be sent.

**Important**: The password is only used during user creation. Terraform cannot read or update passwords after the user is created, as the Metabase API doesn't expose password information.

### Group Membership

To add users to permission groups, use the `metabase_permissions_group_membership` resource separately.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Use the integer ID from the Metabase API.
terraform import metabase_user.user 1
```
